SJADNShareController
=====

###About

SJADNShareController can be used to share text only (at the moment) to [App.net](http://app.net), either as part of the sharing menu, on Mountain Lion, or alone.

It uses App.net's web post intent and opens the post box already filled in, in the user's browser.
